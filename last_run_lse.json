The last candle shows a small green body, but it doesn't form a Bullish Engulfing pattern as it doesn't completely engulf the previous red body. There's no Hammer pattern as there's no prior downward movement leading to a small body at the bottom. No Swing Low Higher High pattern is visible as the recent candles don't show a clear swing low followed by consistent higher highs.",
