The last candle shows a small green body, but it doesn't form a Bullish Engulfing pattern as it doesn't completely engulf the previous red body. There's no Hammer pattern as there's no prior downward movement evident. No Swing Low Higher High pattern is visible as the recent candles don't show a clear swing low followed by higher highs.",
